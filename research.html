          <h1>Research Areas</h1>
          
          <p>Our research focuses on the theoretical investigation and development of integrated microdevices for:</p> <p> <br>  i) Biomarker protein detection <br>  ii) Bioparticle assembly and interactions <br> iii) Cell separation and trapping for biomedical applications. <br></p> <p> We also investigate fundamental aspect of fluid flow and pressure losses in microchannel with second law perspective specially the correlation between entropy generation and mixing efficiency in microfluidics and electromagnetic heating.

		  <p><h2>Biomarker Protein Detection in Microfluidic Devices</h2></p>
		  
		  <p>One of the major challenges in bio-sensing is the low-abundance of biomarker molecules/proteins in highly diluted analytes, which is often the most crucial in a biological standpoint; especially for early diagnosis of diseases. For example, the biomarker proteins – the cTnI isoforms – that are related to cardiac arrest or heart failure are present so vanishingly small concentration in a relatively small amount of blood that it is very difficult to detect. So concentration of bio-molecules prior to analysis is critical in development of integrated multifunctional lab-on-a chip systems or micro-nanofluidic devices. The goal of our research is to integrate preconcentration and separation steps (isotachophoresis - a non linear electrophoresis technique) with current immunoassay protocols (immobolization and antibody signal amplification) in a microfluidic platform. Specifically in this project we are working with cardiac protein troponin I isoforms which is considered as one of the most reliable biomarker for acute myocardial infarction (MI).

		  <p><strong>Figure:</strong> Time series photos of stacked proteins during isotachophoresis in a gradual 2D step reducing microchannel. The width and depth of the channel varies with location. (a) the proteins starts to stacking (b) the proteins have gathered most of its total mass and some sample is lost due to migration through T-junction (c) the proteins have experienced depth change with 10x reduction and protein bands become more vivid d) the proteins are passing through the width change and two distinct bands become wider d) the proteins are in the narrower channel with 100x reduction and bands become more distinct with some separation (f) the proteins have stacked and concentrated with little separation.

			<p><h2>DEP Particle-Particle Interactions and Assembly</h2>In dielectrophoresis (DEP), an applied electric field polarizes dielectric particles or materials and hence causes a net force due to unequal electric fields on the accumulated charges. DEP works both on charged and neutral particles. We developed a hybrid immersed boundary-immersed interface numerical method to study DEP particle-particle interactions, assembly and transport in microfluidic devices. Our research reveals that within a close proximity, particles form a chain (either parallel to electric field or perpendicular to the electric field) regardless of initial orientation, locations, size and electrical properties.  Our study also proposed a microfluidic design where particles can be assembled in a junction of microfluidic device.
