          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>I'm currently a freshman at University of Central Oklahoma studying Software Engineering. My hobbies include playing ping pong, travelling and coding. I currently work as a Web Developer for the department of Mechanical Engineering and deal with front end development using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
          </p>

          <p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused
            communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the application
            according to the client's specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly
            with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.</p>
